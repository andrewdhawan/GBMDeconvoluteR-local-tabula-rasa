**Tumour Intrinsic Genes**

GBM tumour cells are closely related and constantly interact with their
micro-environment, to promotes tumour cell transcriptomic adaptability
and disease progression.

Previously, [Wang et.al
(2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2017.06.003) used *IDH*
wild-type glioblastomas, derivative neurospheres, and single-cell gene
expression profiles to define three tumour-intrinsic transcriptional
subtypes designated as proneural, mesenchymal, and classical. By
selecting ***YES*** (Default), the neoplastic population marker genes
will be filtered to include only those genes which are considered to be
"*tumour-intrinsic*" in GBM.
